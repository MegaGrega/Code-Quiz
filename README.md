# Code-Quiz

The application is a timed multiple choice quiz that deducts time for each wrong answer.
The score at the end is the time remaining on the clock.
If the clock reaches 0, the quiz ends.

Each runthrough of the quiz changes the order of the answers to the question so that they are not in the same place each time.

At the end, the quiz has an input field where you can input your name.

It saves the name and score to local storage and presents it on a highscore page.
